            <p><a href="#about">About this project</a></p>
            <p>The kids have been enjoying Super Mario Party (the Nintendo Switch game from 2018), and while playing
              I've been curious about the wildly different dice blocks each character has.<p>
            <p>Super Mario Party is basically a board game; every turn you roll a die to see how far you
              move. But each character has their own special die with different values on the side, and on each
              turn you can use a normal die (with values 1-6), your character's die, or the die of any allies you've
              recruited along the way.
              Note that some dice have sides that will give or take away coins instead of letting you move. Here's a list of dice
              <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Party#Dice_Blocks">(source)</a>:</p>
              <table id="diceTable"></table>
            <p>So, let's dive in!</p>
            <h2>Initial hypothesis</h2>
            <p>Just from playing the game, my first guess was that <b>dice with greater volatility would have a
              higher average value</b>. A prime example of this to me was Bowser's die, which has values
             -3 coins, -3 coins, 1, 8, 9, 10. It's very volatile but the total value of the moves on the die is 28, much
             higher than a standard die's total value of 21! (this also sounded to me like the financial idea that
             riskier assets should have higher rewards on average. I realize this is reading waaaay into this video game :-) ) </p>
            <p>So my first step was to graph the sum of all the die's faces versus the standard deviation of
              the die's faces.
